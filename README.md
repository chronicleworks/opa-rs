# Rust OPA Client

A client-side SDK for [Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/) that supports interacting with OPA via [HTTP](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/integration/#integrating-with-the-rest-api) and [WebAssembly](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/wasm/) using [Wasmtime](https://docs.wasmtime.dev/introduction.html).

The library is work-in-progress, only supporting the core features and also lacks extensive tests and documentation.

**The library is not part of the official OPA project**, so don't expect the same level of support to be available.
